# Rust Web Example
This is a example web application written in rust. It will try to include common things that you would find in a web application. It is a work in progress and might not have the best way to do things. Here are some of the expected features.

### Work In Progress
- [X] Server Side Routing
- [X] Server Side Templating
- [ ] Server Side State
- [ ] Client Side Routing
- [ ] Client Side Templating
- [ ] Client Side State
- [ ] Database Access (CRUD) - partially implemented
- [ ] JSON Request/Response
- [ ] XML Request/Response
- [ ] Update DOM
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Others

This may not be a complete list but gives an idea of what this repository is about.

### Setup
I will attempt to make a better guide to setup things up later. For now you will have to just figure it out.

Things you will need.

rust (nightly)
cargo
mysql server
mysql client libs
diesel_cli

Look at the notes there might be some valuable information in them.
